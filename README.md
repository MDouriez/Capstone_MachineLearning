split_file.py enables you to split a csv file with different types of values recorded into new csv files

Ex: if you recorded Temperature and Pressure, you will get two new files.


plot.py enbables you to plot your data

Just enter the file name and the type of value you are plotting (accelerometer, temperature, humidity...) and it should extract the data and plot them
